CHAPTER 66:01
MINES AND MINERALS
Ownership of minerals is vested in the Republic of Botswana.
The Act does not apply to petroleum.
Persons or entities wishing to acquire mineral concessions must apply to the Ministry of Mineral Resources, Green Technology and Energy Security.
Restrictions exist on the acquisition of mineral concessions, with preference given to enterprises registered in Botswana and arrangements for local participation.
Administration of mining rights includes:
7. Power of certain officers to enter upon prospecting areas, with the right to inspect works, take samples, and ensure compliance.
8. Officers may require production of company records, safety documentation, and environmental compliance reports.
12. Preference for Botswana products in procurement, and support for local beneficiation.
Prospecting Licences:
13. Applications require a detailed prospecting program, financial provisions for rehabilitation, and a plan for local stakeholder engagement.
17. Duration and renewal depend on initial findings and compliance with technical, financial, and environmental obligations.
21. Obligations of licence holders include record-keeping, health and safety monitoring, and regular reporting to the Department of Mines.
23. Transfers of prospecting licences must be approved and include a review of ownership structure and local content.
Page 2 – Latest Amendments: Local Ownership and Value Addition (2025)
As of October 1, 2025, Botswana enforces a new rule requiring mining companies to sell a 24% stake in new concessions to local investors if the government declines to buy the stake. Previously, the Mines and Minerals Act allowed the government a right to a 15% stake in mining concessions and up to a higher percentage in diamond projects.
The amendment aims to:
	•	Increase local participation in mining,
	•	Promote in-country mineral processing (“as far as is economically feasible”),
	•	Encourage value-added initiatives for minerals beyond diamonds, including copper and nickel,
	•	Prioritize domestic companies in procurement.
Mining firms must now:
	•	Detail plans for local value addition and beneficiation in concession applications,
	•	Set up dedicated environmental rehabilitation funds, and demonstrate their financial capacity to restore mining sites,
	•	Disclose sources of local capital, especially where Botswana pension funds are involved (new law mandates pension funds reduce offshore investments and redirect capital to local mining ventures).
Stakeholder engagement now includes active recruitment of local investors/corporations capable of assuming a 24% stake in any new mining operation and full transparency on value addition and environmental protocols.
Page 3 – Compliance, Reporting, and Penalties
Operating mines must meet strict compliance and reporting obligations:
	•	Every operating mine, quarry, or works must be managed and worked in accordance with the Act and other laws,
	•	Breaches of regulations or operating more than seven days without a manager incur a penalty of up to P100, with an additional P50 per day,
	•	Occurrences of breaches must be reported in writing to an inspector by the responsible mine manager, including those committed by contractors or employees.
If a mine operates without a manager:
	•	Duties, obligations, and responsibilities devolve to appointed supervisors, the owner, or agent, who are then accountable as if they were the manager,
	•	Strict accountability for all matters at the mine, quarry, or works.
Reporting and transparency:
	•	Regular submission of environmental compliance, safety, and production records,
	•	Maintenance of rehabilitation funds and periodic reporting on fund usage,
	•	Annual audit by the Department of Mines and public disclosure of ownership structures for all new concessions.
Environmental Protection:
	•	All new projects require a comprehensive Environmental Impact Assessment,
	•	Rehabilitation plans must be enacted and funded, with innovation (such as new reclamation techniques) encouraged.
Penalties serve as both deterrent and corrective tools to ensure sustained compliance and stakeholder responsibility.
Page 4 – Botswana Mining Sector Metrics and Recent Trends (2024-2025)
Botswana is the world’s top producer of diamonds by value and an emerging copper mining hub.
	•	In Q1 2025, the Index of Physical Mining Production was 77.2, a 9% decrease over Q1 2024 (previously 84.9), reflecting tightening economic conditions.
	•	Diamonds contributed approximately 70% of total export revenue in 2024, with copper output rising sharply by 12% thanks to new projects like Khoemacau Copper Mine.
	•	GDP declined by 0.3% in 2023 and is predicted to drop by another 0.4% in 2024/2025, mainly due to weak diamond demand and synthetic competition.
	•	Local communities benefit from mining through funds for environmental and social development. The “Mining for Communities” program invested USD 15 million in health and education close to major mine sites in 2024.
	•	Karowe and Motheo mines committed 1% of annual profits to local development initiatives.
	•	Pension assets in Botswana are estimated at several billion dollars; repatriation has led to greater involvement in mining investments.
Environmental and sustainability initiatives:
	•	Mandatory biodiversity plans for all new licences.
	•	The implementation of a national mining sustainability dashboard to track water, carbon, and reclamation metrics.
